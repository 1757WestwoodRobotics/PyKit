New Projects
------------

For new projects, it is highly reccomended to start with a `template project <template_projects/index.html>`_ attached to the `latest release <https://github.com/1757WestwoodRobotics/PyKit/releases/latest>`_. These template projects have PyKit already integrated and set up for use. They projects also have docmuntation and setup instructions

* `2025 Kitbot Template <template_projects/kitbot_2025.html>`_. For robots based on the 2025 FIRST KitBot.
* `Diff Drive Template <template_projects/diff_drive.html>`_. For robots using a differential drive system, otherwise known as tank drive.
* `Skeleton Template <template_projects/skeleton.html>`_. A barebones template project with PyKit integrated, but without any control logic

Existing Projects
-----------------

See our migration guide for `existing projects <existing_projects.html>`_ to integrate PyKit into your existing robot code.
